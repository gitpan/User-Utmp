1.5   Sun Sep 16 21:18:43 UTC 2001
	- in ut_addr, addresses containing NULL bytes (e.g.,
	  127.0.0.1) were truncated
	- unlike utmp ut_addr, utmpx ut_addr was not converted to a
	  string (but the documentation claimed it was)
	- reworked example.pl
	- added test for utmpx to test.pl
	- some editing of the documentation
	- some minor changes due to moving from CVS to PRCS; the PRCS
	  project version is now used as release version

1.6	Mon Sep 17 15:10:23 UTC 2001
	- EMPTY is no longer unconditionally defined in Linux hint
	  file (it wasn't defined on older Linux versions); if
	  necessary it's defined in Utmp.xs
	- tests should be more robust
