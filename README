User::utmp

Copyright © 1998 Michael Piotrowski. All Rights Reserved.

Description
-----------

This module provides a simple Perl interface to utmp-style databases
on UNIX systems, the most important being /etc/utmp, which provides
information about users currently logged in.  For more details see the
POD documentation embedded in the file Utmp.pm.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your system should be compliant with SVID2 or at least provide
setutent(), getutent(), endutent(), utmpname() functions compliant
with SVID2.

Building the module
-------------------

The module can be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

Installation
------------

    make install

History
-------

User::Utmp was developed as a quick solution for a project at hand.
It's therefore a straightforward translation of the C interface to
Perl, but reduces the number of functions from four to two.  It has
the following limitations:

- It's not object-oriented
- It's not reentrant and therefore not thread-safe
- It reads the whole file

User::Utmp is used extensively in an in-house project and seems to
work well.  However, since it has not been tested elsewhere, consider
this a beta release.

Feedback
--------

User::Utmp was only tested on HP-UX 10.20.  If you are building the
module on another architecture I would appreciate a note about how you
got on.
