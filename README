User::utmp

Description
-----------

This module provides a simple Perl interface to utmp- and utmpx-style
databases on UNIX systems, the most important being /etc/utmp, which
provides information about users currently logged in.  There is also
experimental support for writing utmp files.  For further details see
the POD documentation embedded in the file Utmp.pm, which will also be
installed as User::Utmp(3) manpage, and the example.pl script.

Prerequisites
-------------

Your system should be compliant with SVID2 or at least provide
setutent(), getutent(), endutent(), utmpname() functions compliant
with SVID2.

Utmpx is supported if your system complies with the Single UNIX
Specification.

Hint files are provided for AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris.  If you're
using a system for which there is no hint file, User::Utmp will be
built with basic utmp support, and, if the _XOPEN_UNIX macro is
defined, with basic utmpx support.  If you want to use additional
fields provided by your system's implementation, you'll have to define
the appropriate flags.

BSD systems typically provide no utmp functions at all and are thus
unsupported.

Portability note
----------------

Unfortunately, the contents of the utmp structure are highly
system-dependent, making multi-platform support difficult.

Utmpx is formally standardized, but the definition leaves a lot of
things to the implementation.

Therefore User::Utmp uses hint files (see the hints directory and the
ExtUtils::MakeMaker man page) to control the inclusion of
system-dependent code.  Note that the Linux hint file enables support
for the ut_host and ut_addr fields; these fields exist on the system I
tested it, which is fairly recent.  Older versions of Linux seem to
have much more limited Utmp implementations.

There might be problems with utmpname() on Solaris due to the
underlying utmpxname(3) function.  I'd appreciate any information on
this matter.

Building the module
-------------------

The module can be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

Besides testing if the module is loadable, "make test" currently
contains only one other test.  This test checks if a utmp record
matching the current user and tty can be found.  I *think* this is
pretty portable, but if it fails, it might be because that the
assumptions made by the test do not apply to your system, not because
User::Utmp doesn't work.

I'd appreciate any ideas for portable tests.

Also included is the script example.pl, which can be used for further
testing.

Installation
------------

    make install

History
-------

User::Utmp was developed as a quick solution for a project at hand.
It's therefore a straightforward translation of the C interface to
Perl, but reduces the number of functions from four to two.  It
currently has the following limitations:

- It's not object-oriented
- It's not reentrant and therefore not thread-safe
- It reads the whole file

Feedback
--------

User::Utmp was tested on HP-UX 10.20, Solaris 2.5.1 and 7 and Linux
2.0.36, and reported to work on AIX.  If you are building the module
on another architecture I'd appreciate a note about how you got on.
